## Introduction

There are three main areas of clinical prediction model performance: discrimination, calibration, and net benefit. These can be assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curves. For ROC and calibration curves, it is important to also view confidence intervals or bands. Survival models often have censored data which makes ROC and calibration curves more difficult.

Previous packages either allow for right-censoring or give confidence intervals; however, there is not yet an easy method for both. This package was created to build upon previous methods and to fill the gap in current tools.

```{r}
library(SurvValPlots)
```

## Example data

We will use two data sets from the survival (Therneau 2023) package to demonstrate the functions in survPlots

-   Rotterdam - 2,982 participants with breast cancer in the Rotterdam tumour bank (Royston and Altman 2013).

-   GBSG - 686 patients from the German Breast Cancer Study Group (Royston and Altman 2013).

A simple model will be developed using the Rotterdam data and the GBSG data will be used for external validation.

## Model

To demonstrate the package, we will develop a Cox proportional hazards model using `survival::coxph`. This is the same model as used by Royston and Altman (Royston and Altman 2013).

```{r}
library(survival)
mod = coxph(Surv(rtime, recur)~size+meno+hormon+age+nodes+pgr+er, 
            data=rotterdam,
            x=TRUE)
mod
```

## ROC curves

ROC curves are one of the most reported visualisations of model performance.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
survPlots(mod, 
          time=365.25*3, 
          df=rotterdam,
          eventVar = "recur",
          timeVar = "rtime",
          plotType = "ROC")
```

## Calibration curves

Calibration curves are a vital, but overlooked performance metric (Van Calster et al. 2019). There are several packages already available in R for constructing calibration curves (Harrell Jr 2023; Sadatsafavi, Safari, and Lee 2023; Van Calster et al. 2016; Gerds 2023). The calibration curve in `pec` accounts for the right censored data using the jackknife pseudo-values (Gerds 2023); however, no confidence interval or band is displayed. Confidence intervals and bands can be useful to show potential variation in the calibration. The calibration curve in `CalibrationCurves` does have confidence bands, but does not account for censoring.

The calibration curve in `SurvValPlots` uses the jackknife pseudo-values to account for right-censoring and also uses loess smoothing with 95% confidence bands.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
survPlots(mod, 
          time=365.25*3, 
          df=rotterdam,
          eventVar = "recur",
          timeVar = "rtime",
          plotType = "Calibration")
```

## Decision curves

The net benefit of a model can be define as

$$
NB = \frac{TP}{n}-\frac{FP}{n}\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)-H,
$$

where

-   $TP$ is the number of true positives
-   $FP$ is the number of false negatives
-   $n$ is the total number of observations
-   $p$ is the chosen probability threshold
-   $H$ is the harm of the model

The harm of a model can be estimated in terms of how many patients the clinician is willing to put through the test to catch one positive case ($N_p$), with the harm being $H=1/N_p$.

The net benefit can then be plotted across a range of clinically relevant probability thresholds. The net benefit of treating all or no patients as having the disease or condition can also be plotted for reference.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
survPlots(mod, 
          time=365.25*3, 
          df=rotterdam,
          eventVar = "recur",
          timeVar = "rtime",
          plotType = "Decision")
```

## All

Setting the option `plotType="All"` plots all three of the graphs into one panel. This allows an easy visualisation of overall discrimination, calibration, and net benefit at a chosen time point with a single, short command.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
survPlots(mod, 
          time=365.25*3, 
          df=rotterdam,
          eventVar = "recur",
          timeVar = "rtime",
          plotType = "All")
```

## More complex models

```{r}
library(mfp)
mod <-mfp(
          Surv(rtime, recur) ~ 
            size+
            meno+
            hormon+
            fp(age)+
            fp(nodes)+
            fp(pgr)+
            fp(er),
     data=rotterdam, family=cox)
summary(mod)
```

```{r}
survPlots(
  model = mod,
  time = 3*365.25,
  df = rotterdam,
  eventVar = "recur",
  timeVar = "rtime",
  plotType="All")
```
